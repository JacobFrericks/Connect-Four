Connect-Four
============

This project was designed to run in the command line of Eclipse. As documented in the Report, there is no GUI for this project. To run, simply run Main.java and follow the prompts in the Eclipse Console.

Feel free to use whatever part of the code you wish, for whatever reason you wish. This project was a learning experience for me, and I want others to be able to learn from it without worrying about breaking the rules. However, if you do end up using this code, or if it was helpful to you, please send me an email! I'd love to hear about what you're building.
